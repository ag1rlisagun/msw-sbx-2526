# Mission Spacewalker - CAN-SBX 2025-2026
Repository for the 2025–2026 CAN-SBX project creating a capillary-driven bioreactor to evaluate radiation-induced changes in the organism’s ability to generate bioelectricity in real time through a photosynthetic air-cathode system by continuously measuring current output and oxygen evolution throughout the stratospheric profile.

A Raspberry Pi will be used to: collect data from a temperature sensor to then regulate the temperature of the system, a voltage sensor to calculate the current generated by the cyanobacteria, as well as a dissolved oxygen sensor to measure the photosynthetic activity in the cell.

# Requirements for Pi:

## Hardware:  
- Raspberry Pi 4 
- microSD card  
  - Minimum: 8 GB  
  - Recommended: 16–32 GB, Class 10  
- SD card reader for your computer (macOS/PC/Linux)  
- Power supply appropriate for Pi model  

## Operating System:  
Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit): Fully supports GPIO, I²C, 1-Wire, Python, and Blinka  

## Install Using Raspberry Pi Imager:  

## On your computer:  
- Download Raspberry Pi Imager from the official Raspberry Pi website  
- Install it for macOS, Windows, or Linux  

## Write the OS to the microSD Card:  
- Insert the microSD card into your computer  
- Launch Raspberry Pi Imager  
- Click Choose OS  
  - Select: Raspberry Pi OS (other) → Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)  
- Click Choose Storage  
  - Select your microSD card  

## Configure OS Settings:

Before writing, click the gear icon (Advanced Options), enable and set the following:  

- Set hostname
  - Example:  
  `pi-sensor-node`  
- Enable SSH  
- Choose “Use password authentication”  
- Set username and password (Do not rely on default credentials)  
- Configure Wi-Fi (if applicable)  
- Set SSID, Password  
- Set Country code (important for regulatory compliance)   
- Set locale, Time zone  
- Keyboard layout  

Click Save, then Write.  

Boot the Raspberry Pi, insert the microSD card into the Pi and connect power, wait ~60–90 seconds for first boot.  

If headless:  

The Pi will connect to Wi-Fi automatically, SSH will be available  

Connect via SSH from another machine:   

`ssh <username>@<hostname>.local`  

If .local does not resolve, use the Pi’s IP address.  

### Initial System Configuration:  

Update the System.  
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo reboot
```

Enable Required Interfaces.

Run:  
`sudo raspi-config`  

Enable: 
- I2C  
  - Interface Options → I2C → Enable  
- 1-Wire  
  - Interface Options → 1-Wire → Enable  

Exit and reboot when prompted.      

Verify Installation.  
 
- Confirm OS Version   
`cat /etc/os-release`  
  - You should see:   
`Raspberry Pi OS Lite`   
- Verify I²C    
`ls /dev/i2c-*`  
  - Expected:  
`/dev/i2c-1`  
- Verify 1-Wire  
`ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/`   
  - Expected (after connecting DS18B20):  
`28-xxxxxxxxxxxx`  

## Install Core Development Tools  
```
sudo apt install -y \
  python3 \
  python3-pip \
  python3-venv \
  git \
  i2c-tools \
  build-essential
```
