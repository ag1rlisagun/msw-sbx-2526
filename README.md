# mission spacewalker - can-sbx 2025-2026
repository for the 2025–2026 CAN-SBX project creating a capillary-driven bioreactor to evaluate radiation-induced changes in the organism’s ability to generate bioelectricity in real time through a photosynthetic air-cathode system by continuously measuring current output and oxygen evolution throughout the stratospheric profile.

a Raspberry Pi will be used to: collect data from a temperature sensor to then regulate the temperature of the system, a voltage sensor to calculate the current generated by the cyanobacteria, as well as a dissolved oxygen sensor to measure the photosynthetic activity in the cell.
